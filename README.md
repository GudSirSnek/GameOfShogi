# GameOfShogi
A game of Shogi that I made for a school Computer Science Project.


For my computer Science Class, I had to plan, design and create a program for a particular client.
My client wanted a digital game of Shogi.
To create the game I use the python scripting language as well as the pygame game library.
I also used the pyinstaller library to create an .exe which my client wanted the game to be in the form of.
